# Sylphie

A Discord bot for notifying me in real-time about lucrative deals from other players on the market in a game called Shining Moon RO.

## What is this about?

Shining Moon RO is an MMORPG game and as any other game in this genre, it takes some grinding to progress. One of the things you need to do to progress 
in this game is to make money. One way to make money is to sell your stuff to other players. And that's exactly what I do but with a small optimization: I buy cheap 
and sell high. But there's one problem: what if an another player buys that cheap item before me? Well, that's where Sylphie bot comes in. I tell her to watch
for an item and notify me when someone sells that item for a good price. This happens in real-time so I'm usually the fastest to buy that cheap item.
